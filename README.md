# tdd-talk-app
Example app for my talk, [Practical TDD in JavaScript](https://github.com/justinmc/tdd-talk).  View it live at [https://justinmc.github.io/tdd-talk-app/](https://justinmc.github.io/tdd-talk-app/).

## Development
To get started developing on this app, run the following:

    npm install
    npm start

A development server will start at port 8080 and any changes will automatically update.

Then to run the tests in TDD mode, run this:

    npm run tdd
